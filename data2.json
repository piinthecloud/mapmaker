Police say Allen disobeyed them, had reached for something in his pocket and was attempting to roll over, causing Leal to “fear for his own life.” But marks on Allen’s hands indicate he had been handcuffed. Two grand jury members said they felt pressured to not indict by a politically connected fellow juror. Both officers were no-billed.\n\nNot only did these cops get away with murder, but the shooter, Officer Leal, has since been promoted within his department. He now supervises everyone who investigated him. The Bellaire Police Dept. basically congratulated him for killing an unarmed teenager. ",

The investigation revealed the occurrence of the following events. Lawrence Kitchen became involved in a dispute with a neighbor's visitor over parking in the multi-unit residential property. Kitchen armed himself with a shotgun and handgun. He confronted Michelle Velasquez and shot her with the shotgun, injuring her and killing a small dog she was holding. Kitchen then pointed his weapon at Eusebio Ruiz who was attempting to seek refuge in apartment #1. Kitchen shot Ruiz in the torso and leg. When confronted by officers and instructed to drop the weapon and get down, he pointed his weapon at Lompoc Police Officers Dan Sessions and Willie Francis. Both officers fired at Kitchen. They hit Kitchen twice. Kitchen died at the scene. The District Attorney's role in reviewing this homicide is to determine whether the shooting of Lawrence Alan Kitchen was lawful and to provide a detailed explanation to the public about the facts and the law in that regard. As stated in Graham v. Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, this process \"requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances.\" Hence, this analysis will give careful attention to both the facts and the circumstances of the fatal shooting of Lawrence Alan Kitchen.",

He was driving home to his off-campus apartment from a bar when Carter said he noticed Redus weaving between lanes and decided to follow him, although he did not know the driver was a UIW student.\n\nUniversity officials have repeatedly claimed Carter had the right as a sworn police office to interrupt his late night food run to a nearby Whataburger and pursue Redus, even though he was off campus and did not know the driver was a UIW student. Carter has been on paid leave since the incident, and in its response to the civil lawsuit UIW officials defended his shooting of Redus as justified.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Carter’s version of events from the point he began to follow Redus north on Broadway through Alamo Heights, but what is not in dispute is that Carter attempted to arrest Redus outside his apartment as he exited his vehicle and a scuffle ensued. Carter said Redus resisted arrest and fought with him before Carter finally fired six shots at close range, striking Redus five times.",

A violent brawl at close quarters erupted in gunfire when Franklin grabbed an MP5 machine pistol hanging from the shoulder of one of the officers and pulled the trigger, hitting officers Michael Meath and Ricardo Muro in the legs. Both survived. DNA analysis later showed that Franklin had touched the trigger of the gun.\nFearing that he was about to be shot, officer Lucas Peterson shot Franklin four times. Meath told investigators that he also shot four times at Franklin. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s autopsy found 10 bullet wounds on Franklin’s body; a police spokesman said that’s possible if some of the eight bullets the police fired made more than one wound as they passed through Franklin’s body.",

I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.\n\nPolice were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7\" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8\" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4\" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.\n\nThe following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.  \n\n\n",

Three deputies approached Scott from one side of the aisle and two from the other, the report said.\n\nSheriff’s office officials said that Scott did not respond to commands to drop her weapons and that the deputies were unable to subdue her with the Taser weapon. Plowman said Wednesday that it remained unclear whether the stun gun failed because of mechanical problems According to the report, Scott showed no reaction to the Taser discharge but instead turned toward the three deputies at one end of the aisle and charged at them with the knife and scissors raised. Then, one of the three deputies — identified as K. Foster in the report — fired five shots, striking Scott four times and killing her. Another deputy was struck by a bullet in the leg, possibly the result of a ricochet, Plowman said.",

No one answered him so he opened the door with the Wii remote still in his hand. The female officer already had her gun drew and saw the remote, assumed it was a weapon and shot my nephew in the chest. She never said put down your weapon she just shot. The male officer told the female officer to put her gun away because it was only a remote control. She didn’t.\n\nChristopher’s little sister started towards Christopher because he had already fell to the floor so this female officer pointed her gun at my niece who by the way is 13 years old and told her to shut up and stay where she was. I have friends that are cops and I respect the law but this was a murder.",

They remained in that position while the other officers tried to pin Mylo's arms.\n\nThe teen still was talking. Then, officers reported, he suddenly slipped into unconsciousness. Handcuffs were snapped around his wrists. Officers bound his feet with nylon straps. When his family read the reports later, it bothered them that one of the restraints used was the leash a police dog handler had been carrying in her uniform pocket.\n\nMylo was placed on a paramedic's backboard and strapped down. The officers told the aid crew waiting nearby that Mylo, though unconscious, had a pulse and was still breathing.\n\nThe paramedics moved in and quickly realized that wasn't so. They got Mylo's heart pumping and restored his breathing.\n\nAn ambulance raced him to the hospital, where doctors determined his brain had died. There was nothing doctors could do. Four days later, Mylo took his last breath.",

Allen then chased the car down the street on foot while firing an additional 10 shots, which forced other officers to take cover. Police Chief Art Acevedo fired him for this and faulted Allen’s recollection of the events, saying he gave an account “that was completely not aligned with what evidence and facts showed. I’ve never seen a case where an officer’s recollection was this poor,” he said.\nBut a grand jury declined to indict.",

Bazzi allegedly drove toward the Dearborn officer who pulled him over and attempted to strike him with his car according to police, which led to the officer firing five shots at Bazzi's car. \nWitnesses at the scene also confirmed they heard five shots that sounded like pistol fire. \nBazzi was not hit by the shots and continued driving and crashed into another vehicle shortly afterward, ending up in front of the ACCESS sign where clothes and several other items were strewn all over the middle of Schaefer Road. \nAfter the crash, Bazzi attempted to flee and was captured by officers. Both Bazzi and the arresting officer suffered minor injuries according to Dearborn Police and were treated at a local hospital. According to Majed Moughni, a Dearborn-based attorney who has agreed to take on Bazzi's case pro bono, Bazzi was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and was not taking his medication, which may have caused him to have a fearful, irrational reaction.\nMoughni also said that the shots were aimed at the backseat of Bazzi's car. The debris scattered all over the road was likely from his car, which he had been living out of according to Moughni. Bazzi had originally offered to pay Moughni with food stamps to defend him. \nMoughni also said that a witness told him that Bazzi was \"beaten up pretty well\" by police after he attempted to flee. \nNo matter what happens in the meantime, the likely final outcome is that Bazzi, a Lebanese immigrant, is deported, said Moughni. With Bazzi’s previous felony conviction and a laundry list of new felonies pending against him, immigration authori-ties have issued a prisoner hold, meaning that even if he posts the $300,000 bond for this case, he will remain in custody to be dealt with by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Bazzi, 39, immigrated in 1991 and is a legal resident, Moughni said.\n\nAsked what is his goal for his client in this case, Moughni said, “to have him deported as soon as possible so that taxpayers don’t have to pay unnecessary costs.”\n\ndashcam video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CUiDN6mYX8\nhttp://www.pressandguide.com/articles/2011/12/22/news/doc4ef38484bb0d5610817606.txt\n\n",

Officer Johannes Mehserle and another officer were restraining Grant, who was lying face down and allegedly resisting arrest.[4][5][6] Officer Mehserle stood and, according to his attorney, said: \"Get back, I'm gonna Tase him.\"[7] Then Mehserle drew his gun and shot Grant once in the back. During his court testimony, Mehserle said that Grant then exclaimed, \"You shot me!\"[3][4][8] Grant was unarmed; he was pronounced dead the next morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland.[8]",

A passing stranger helped them change the tire, but the spare was also flat, so the man led them to a filling station. But the tire would not inflate, and so Ms. Miller waited in the car while the man drove her friend home to get assistance from the family. When relatives arrived they found Ms. Miller apparently comatose in the locked car, with the engine running and the radio on. She was shaking bodily and foaming at the mouth, and had a .380 semi-automatic pistol in her lap.[2][3] Unable to wake her they called 9-1-1. Four Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes and, informed by family members of the presence of a gun in the car, approached the vehicle with guns drawn.[3] After attempting for several minutes to get a response from Miller, the decision was made to force entry into the vehicle as Miller was in apparent need of immediate medical attention.[3] As one of the officers was attempting to remove the gun, Miller is said to have sat up and grabbed the weapon at which point the officers opened fire 23 times, hitting Ms. Miller with at least 12 bullets, including four in the head. The officers involved, three white and one Hispanic, were placed on administrative leave. They claimed they had acted in self-defense.\n\nThe releasing of the coroner's report prompted protests from the community, who rallied at the police headquarters, demanding an independent investigation, amongst suggestions that institutional racism had played a role.The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to \"insufficient evidence.\"\nnyt story: http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/us/unanswered-questions-in-a-fatal-police-shooting.html?ref=tyisha_miller\n\nSickening CBS News headline: Did Tyisha Miller Have To Die? http://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-tyisha-miller-have-to-die/",

        "summary": "SAN ANTONIO — University of the Incarnate Word student Cameron Redus, a 23-year-old, was shot five times — including once in the back — during a fatal altercation with a campus police officer last year, according to an autopsy report released Thursday by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's office.\n\nAuthorities said the shooting came after a six-minute struggle in the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments in Alamo Heights, where Redus lived.\n\nA toxicology test also showed Redus had a blood alcohol content of .155, nearly twice the legal limit to drive, when authorities say he fought UIW officer Christopher Carter on Dec. 6 in the parking lot of Redus' off-campus apartment complex near Incarnate Word.\n\nThe Dec. 7 autopsy conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Peacock found that five bullets had struck Redus in the left eye, upper chest, left elbow, right hip and upper back. The report didn't say which wounds came first, but it concluded that the shot to the back was the “most immediately lethal.”\n\nAt a past press conference, Alamo Heights Police Chief Richard Pruitt said Carter was driving on Broadway in a marked UIW police pickup truck when he spotted another truck being driven erratically. It was in the early morning hours of Dec. 6, and Carter saw the truck strike a curb and swerve briefly into the oncoming lanes.\n\nCarter followed the suspected drunken driver. He was outside his jurisdiction, but Carter was a licensed peace officer authorized to arrest DWI suspects anywhere in Texas.\n\nThe officer followed Redus and activated the emergency lights of his police truck near the Treehouse Apartments, where Redus parked and got out of his vehicle.\n\nThe dash cam of Carter's truck didn't record video of the altercation, but Carter was wearing a microphone that recorded audio. Pruitt said the recording captured Carter asking Redus to stop and put his hands on the truck. Redus complied, but began to struggle when Carter started to handcuff him, Pruitt said.\n\nDuring the six-minute confrontation, Carter told Redus 14 times to put his hands behind his back and told him three times that he was under arrest, Pruitt said. Carter told Redus to stop resisting 56 times, Pruitt said.\n\nRedus at one point grabbed Carter's police baton and struck the officer with it, authorities said.\n\nCarter regained control of the baton and Redus broke free. Pruitt said Carter drew his handgun, ordered Redus to stop, and Redus charged him with his hand raised. Carter fired six times.\n\n• http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/UIW-Student-slain-by-campus-officer-was-5525223.php\n• http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Autopsy-UIW-student-shot-in-the-back-5335693.php\n• http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Witness-UIW-student-fought-officer-before-fatal-5077162.php#/0",

The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, “exchanged words” with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.\n\nA witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.\n\nThe witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.\n\nEncina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.\n\nAt that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.\n\nThe witness said Encina then fired shots.\n\nJones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.\n\nAn arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.\n\n• http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Man-jailed-in-incident-that-led-to-fatal-shooting-5290557.php\n• http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Lawsuit-Cop-targeted-minorities-in-incident-5405382.php\n• http://www.kens5.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/10664486/\n• http://www.kens5.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/10664384/\n• http://www.sanantonio.gov/Commpa/News/TabId/317/ArtMID/1970/ArticleID/1445/Councilwoman-Taylor-Releases-Statement-on-Chacho%E2%80%99s-Shooting-Incident.aspx",

Houston’s family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.\n\nThe SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team’s commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.\n\nTo prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.\n\nTeam members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.\n\nAccording to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.\n\nhttp://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/08/13/3329701/deputies-identified-in-spanaway.html\nhttp://www.co.pierce.wa.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1761\n",

Police contend that he hit an officer, and two officers drew guns and began firing to prevent him hitting another officer. Pike's family contend that this was unnecessary and an escalation of force. Police respond that they first used a taser, but to no effect. The officer Pike hit was treated and released from a hospital. The two officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave with pay during an investigation.\n\nThis is the third shooting by GCPD within the month. Other recent GCPD shootings happened April 10th and 22nd\n\nNotes on accuracy for other people to fix:\n1. Total number of shots fired is unknown. The number 6 is a baseless assumption that each of the two officers fired 3 shots, and is just a placeholder due to this form only accepting numbers greater than zero for shots fired. \n2. It is listed as unknown if the victim was armed. This is fuzzy, since driving a car isn't considered 'armed,' but he allegedly used it as a weapon.",

        "summary": "Police initially were responding to domestic disturbance call at Sandlewood Apartments.  (The call was made by a neighbor of Marcus Bell.)  After the police spoke with Marcus Bell and his wife, Mr. Bell went back into his apartment and locked himself in.  Police issued warrants, claiming that his wife had injuries consistent with aggravated assault with a firearm.  (She disputes this and states they had only been arguing loudly.)  At some point in the long standoff with police, a SWAT team was called.  Once police secured warrants, they entered the apartment and shots were fired by police.  Marcus Bell was killed. (It isn't clear when he died from these injuries.  He was taken to hospital and officers refused to comment on his condition.) No officers were injured.  Georgia Bureau of Investigation was reportedly called in to investigate, but I could find no information on any prosecutions or police disciplinary action related to this case.\n\nMultiple sources: \nhttp://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/06/18/clayton-county-officer-involved-shooting/\n\nhttp://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/suspect-recovering-after-police-involved-shooting/nPYHQ/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States,_June_2012\n\nhttp://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/06/18/clayton-county-officer-involved-shooting/\n\nhttp://www.news-daily.com/news/2012/jun/27/clayton-cops-kill-teen-suspect/",

Manuel Diaz, a 20-year department veteran, as the lawman who shot and killed Craig Petersen, 52, a general contractor suspected of fatally stabbing a 71-year-old Borrego Springs resident.\n\nSheriff’s homicide unit Sgt. Roy Frank released new details on the case Thursday, saying Petersen went to the home of George Mendenhall, on Borrego Hills Road, about 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday “regarding some tools.”\n\nAfter Petersen left, a female member of Mendenhall’s family found Mendenhall in the garage, bleeding, about 7 a.m. He had been stabbed several times in the chest, and died a short time later, Frank said.\n\n“The motive is still under investigation,” Frank said. “We are finalizing interviews to try to find out what the motive was.”\n\nAt least one witness provided deputies with information that Petersen was the suspect in the slaying. Deputies then launched a manhunt for him across the small desert community.\n\nPetersen lived in a Borrego Springs trailer park and had known Mendenhall for about 10 years, Frank said.\n\nAbout 1 p.m., Diaz was on patrol in the area of Japatul Valley and Descanso when he saw a light blue Ford F150 pickup in the Park and Ride lot at Interstate 8 and state Route 79. A man was in the cargo bed. Frank said that as Diaz approached, the man, subsequently identified as Petersen, grabbed a nail gun.\n\nFrank said Diaz saw the man reach for something that looked like a weapon, and fired. Petersen fell in the truck bed.",

Crowell told investigators he drew his gun and yelled, “Drop the knife!” He said Hill then cocked his arm and took a step toward him.

The police said the intruder was Mr. Doerbecker.\n\nMs. Donnelly’s house is across the street from the Doerbeckers’. The intruder fled out the front door when she yelled, she said. Officers connected the investigative dots and soon went to the Doerbeckers’, where they tried but failed to have Kurt Doerbecker come out after speaking with him and his father, Lieutenant Smith said.\n\nAt that point, police officers took up positions around the house, Lieutenant Smith said. At least 20 officers initially responded, he said. Three of them were on the north side of the home when they saw a man exit through a ground-floor window. One officer was ultimately “forced to fire,” the police said.\n\nAn autopsy on Mr. Doerbecker conducted on Tuesday showed that a single bullet hit him in the head, according to a law enforcement official, though the precise entry point was not immediately clear. The officer fired at least three shots, the official said.",

The police spokesperson said one of the officers \"perceived some type of threat\" and shot Fell in the back. Fell later told the press he had been shot while handcuffed on the ground. In addition to the bullet wound, Fell sustained three broken ribs and a punctured lung. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated the incident for use of excessive force, but I couldn't find a result online.",

Merced Police officer started driving toward them. So Pimentel got into the back seat of one of the cars to leave. He says the driver was going less than ten miles per hour -- and was blinded by the bright lights on Officer Maria Botwright-Soto's car -- when he accidentally hit her.\n\nPimentel said, \"He was barely going because we were right in front of the cop car so we were like boom, and then she got hit.\"\n\nPimentel says he immediately heard a gunshot and felt a burning sensation in his back. Pictures obtained by Action News show the bullet traveled through the car's taillight and lodged in the backseat. Pimentel says the impact left this mark on his back.\n\n\"She didn't even give us a chance to stop before she shot, and that's what made the driver really drive off,\" said Pimentel. \"He was real scared and panicking. All of us were scared.\"",

That location is southwest of the Buffalo Drive and Summerlin Parkway interchange.\n\nMetro Police Capt. Patrick Neville said a woman reported she was having an argument with her son and that he was out of control.\n\nPolice arrived and found a man with a butcher knife walking southbound on Firestone Drive. Neville said the man approached officers after authorities made several commands for him to stop.\n\nThe officers then discharged non-lethal rounds at the man, striking him four times, in an attempt to get him to stop, but the man continued toward officers with the knife, Neville said.\n\n\"Officers feared for their lives,\" he said.\n\nThe three officers then fired multiple shots at the man, who was pronounced dead at University Medical Center. Neville said he didn't know how close the officers were to the man when they opened fire.\n\nVictor Chavez, the man's cousin, identified the man who was killed as Rafael Olivas.\n\nChavez, 21, described his cousin’s relationship with his mother as fairly typical, with arguments only once in a while.\n\n“I still can’t believe it,” he said. “It hasn’t set in.”\n\nChavez said one of the last times he saw Olivas — known as “Ralfy” to relatives — was during a party for a younger family member. Olivas lived with his mother and has several siblings, he said.\n\nPolice said the mother wasn't injured during the argument with her son. It wasn’t immediately clear whether other family members were home at the time or what led to the argument.\n\n“All I heard was he had a knife,” said Chavez, who rushed to join family at the scene after the shooting. “That’s no reason to be shot four times.”\n\nThe three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Their names will be released in 48 hours.\n\n\n",

The investigation is ongoing with \"no timetable\" for completion.  The man may have attacked the officers once they entered the house making the death justifiable, but in my mind, it seems the police were a bit to willing to go into the home and confront the armed man (all purely speculative on my part).  It has been reported that he lived alone and I couldn't find any mention of the police finding anyone else in the home.  No hostage, which seems to lend to the general thought that the police had no reason to enter the home without trying a little harder to get the man to surrender peacefully.  My opinion, of course.

Chase ensued and Cranney eventually drove his car straight at the two pursuing officers and then turned perpendicular to their cars and began firing a gun toward them. As the officers maneuvered their vehicles they could no longer retreat in their vehicles. The affidavit states they retrieved their AR-15 rifles, exited their cars and took cover behind their cars. Meanwhile, Cranney circled around, stopped his car in front of the officers, opened his door, stepped out , took a standing two-handed grip position with his gun and pointed the weapon directly toward the officers, fired, adjusted his aim and fired again. The officers returned fire. Cranney got back in his car and started driving in reverse. He and his vehicle were hit by the officers’ bullets and the car came to a stop.",

Ferris fired four shots, three of which hit Norwood in the arm, chest and abdomen. Even if the first officers to respond had been equipped with Tasers, Bennett said using Tasers is not an option when a subject is less than 20 feet away from an officer. In this case, Norwood was about 6 feet away, he said.",

With the officers flanking the vehicle, the teen driver tried to pull away from the curb, striking Rodriguez, who suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon. Wagner, believing his partner was pinned beneath the car and would be dragged as they pulled away, fired repeatedly into the vehicle, police said, killing Carter and wounding the driver.",
